Project Name: Moffat Bay Lodge Website Development

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a website for the Moffat Bay Lodge, a new resort located on Joviedsa Island, Washington State. The website will allow users to explore the lodge, view island attractions, and make reservations for their stay. Key features include user registration, a secure login system, reservation management, and a reservation lookup feature.

Project Objectives:
- Develop a marketing-focused landing page to attract potential customers.
- Create static content pages for "About Us," "Contact Us," and "Attractions."
- Implement a user registration system with secure password encryption.
- Design a login system for returning users.
- Develop a reservation page allowing users to book their stay.
- Implement a reservation summary page for users to confirm or cancel bookings.
- Create a reservation lookup page to allow users to view past reservations.

Key Technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: MySQL for data storage, PHP (or a similar language) for server-side logic
- Security: Password hashing and encryption
